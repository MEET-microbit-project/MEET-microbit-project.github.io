# Welcome to the micro:bit project page!

In the course of a few weeks, you are going to learn how to program in the
popular and widely used [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language.
We are starting out with the [BBC micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) to get a
firm grasp on how to control hardware components and basic programming
techniques. After that, you can let your creativity run free by writing
programs for the [bit:bot](https://4tronix.co.uk/blog/?p=1490) robotic car,
and compete with your fellow programmers in races.
