===============
In session 2 we have shown you some small snapshots of videos to iliustrate various aspect in robotics.
Here we are giving full videos to watch togehter with some other videos for which we did not have time 
to watch.

#### A Compilation of Robots Falling Down at the DARPA Robotics Challenge

The DARPA Robotics Challenge was a prize competition funded by the US Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency. Held from 2012 to 2015, it aimed to develop semi-autonomous ground robots that could do "complex
tasks in dangerous, degraded, human-engineered environments.

#### Shadow Hand manipulates pen

The Shadow Dexterous Hand is a humanoid robot hand system developed by The Shadow Robot Company in London. 
The hand is comparable to a human hand in size and shape, and reproduces all of its degrees of freedom. 
The Hand is commercially available and currently used in range of institutions including NASA,
Bielefeld University and Carnegie Mellon University, and EU research projects such as HANDLE

#### Quadcopter Navigation in the Forest using Deep Neural Networks

The group study the problem of perceiving forest or mountain trails from a single monocular image acquired 
from the viewpoint of a robot traveling on the trail itself. Qualitative and quantitative results computed on a large real-world dataset  show that research groups approach outperforms alternatives, and yields an accuracy comparable to the accuracy of humans that are tested on the same image classification task.

#### Nasa humanoid 'starts work' in UK lab Valkyrie robot

A team at the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics has started work with one of the world's most advanced humanoids on the planet, NASA's Valkyrie robot. The two-legged, human shaped robot has been developed with the ultimate goal of sending robots to explore the surface of Mars.
