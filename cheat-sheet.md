# [](#micro-bit)Micro:Bit
All functionality is contained in a *module* (in other words a library) with the name `microbit`.
In order to be able to use the microbit-specific functions below,
include this line at the top of your program:
```python
from microbit import *
```
In English, this means *"import everything (*`*`*) from the `microbit` library"*.

### [](#sleep)sleep
Sometimes it is useful to make the micro:bit wait, and not do nothing for a while. You can do this by specifying a time in milliseconds (there are 1000 milliseconds in each second):
```python
# sleep for 3 seconds
sleep(3000)
```

## [](#display)Display

### [](#scroll)scroll
You can scroll longer strings of text over the display:
```python
display.scroll("Hello, World!")
```

If you want to scroll something other than a string, you must convert it:
```python
a_number = 42
display.scroll(str(a_number))
```

### [](#show)show
Show something statically on the display:
```python
display.show("!")
```

There are a lot of images available from the `microbit` module:
```python
display.show(Image.HAPPY)
```
For a list of available images see
[here](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/images.html#images).

You can also show a list of images in a sequence that you have put into a list:
```python
my_images = ["Hello!", 42, Image.YES]
display.show(my_images, loop=True, delay=100)
```

## [](#buttons)Buttons
There are two buttons on the micro:bit, `button_a` and `button_b`.
`button_a.get_presses()` returns the number of times button A was pressed since the the last time this function was called.
```python
while True:
    sleep(2000)
    # show the number of times button B was pressed in the last 2 seconds
    display.show(str(button_b.get_presses()))
```

## [](#input-output-pins)Input / Output Pins
The micro:bit pins are accessible through `pin0`, `pin1`, ..., `pin22`.
```python
# set pin1 to 1 (on)
pin1.write_digital(1)
# set pin0 to 0 (off)
pin0.write_digital(0)

# read digital values
pin_value = pin0.read_digital()  # 0 or 1

# write analog value from 0 (low output) up to 1023 (maximum output)
pin0.write_analog(1023)
# read analog value
pin0.read_analog()  # integer number from 0 up to 1023
```

## [](#music)Music
Music controls are in a separate module called `music`.
```python
import music

music.play(music.NYAN, pin=0, loop=false)
```
A list of available music can be found
[here](https://microbit-micropython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/music.html#music).

## [](#accelerometer)Accelerometer
The accelerometer can be used to determine how the micro:bit
is oriented in space.
```python
# a reading of 0 mean the micro:bit is level along this axis
# 1024 is an acceleration of 1g (earth gravity)
reading_x = accelerometer.get_x()
reading_y = accelerometer.get_y()
reading_z = accelerometer.get_z()
```
For more detail and an overview of the axes see
[this article](http://microbit-challenges.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/accelerometer.html).

### [](#gestures)gestures
The micro:bit automatically detects the following gestures:

`"up", "down", "left", "right", "face up", "face down", "freefall", "3g", "6g", "8g", "shake"`

```python
# returns true if the gesture is currently active
accelerometer.is_gesture("face up")
# indicates whether the gesture was active since last function call
accelerometer.was_gesture("shake")
```

# [](#python)Python

## [](#random)Random
There is a python library for generating (pseudo-) random numbers:
```python
import random

# random number between 1 and 6
random_integer = random.randint(1, 6)

my_list = ["left", "right"]
# make a random choice out of a list
random_direction = random.choice(my_list)
```

# [](#bit-bot)Bit:Bot

## [](#bitbot-module)Bitbot Module
To make the beginning easier, we added a module `bitbot` with some basic
functionality. See the [advanced](#advanced) section
to learn how to write these out manually, using the pins.
```python
import bitbot

# set speed in percent
bitbot.set_speed(-100, -100)  # move back as fast as possible
bitbot.set_speed(0, 40)  # only right motor is on

# read brightness
brightness = bitbot.brightness()  # returns a tuple, e.g. (70.2, 70.1)
brightness_left = brightness[0]  # brightness in percent
```

## [](#buzzer)Buzzer
The buzzer is connected to pin 14.
```python
# make an annoying buzzing sound for 2 seconds
pin14.write_digital(1)
sleep(2000)
pin14.write_digital(0)  # don't forget to turn it off again
```

## [](#line-detection)Line Detection
The line detectors are connected to the same pins as the buttons.
This means you can't use the buttons while connected to the
bit:bot, but it also means line detection is very easy:
```python
# this could be part of a line-following program
if button_a.is_pressed():
    # there is a line on the left, move right
```

## [](#neopixel)Neopixel
There is a dedicated `neopixel` module. The relevant pin is pin 13 and there are
12 pixels in the Neopixel array.
```python
import neopixel

np = neopixel.Neopixel(pin13, 12)
np[3] = (255, 0, 0)  # set pin with index 3 to all red
np.show()  # show the changes that were made
```

## [](#advanced)Advanced

| motor | Direction Pin | Speed Pin |
|:------|:--------------|:----------|
| left  | `pin8`        | `pin0`    |
| right | `pin12`       | `pin1`    |

The direction pins are set to a digital value, `0` for forward, `1` for backwards.
The speed pins are set to an analog value (between 0 and 1023).
- If the motor is going forwards, higher values make it move faster.
- If the motor is set to go backwards, lower values make it move faster.
```python
# move forwards with maximal speed
pin8.write_digital(0)
pin12.write_digital(0)
pin0.write_analog(1023)
pin1.write_analog(1023)

# move backwards with maximal speed
pin8.write_digital(1)
pin12.write_digital(1)
pin0.write_analog(0)
pin1.write_analog(0)
```
