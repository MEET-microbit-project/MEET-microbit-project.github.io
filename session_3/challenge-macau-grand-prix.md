Bit:bot Challenge: Macau Grand Prix
====================================

For a bit:bot programming challenge we decided to explore the world of
racing cars, and what would be a better route than the Macau Grand Prix!

Of course, trying to track the whole Grand Prix route may be bit too much for
our challenge because as we talked in previous sessions, the real world is
complex with a lot of uncertainties in it. Moreover if our little bit:bots would
try to travel the whole route it would take a long time and the batteries
might not last.

In our challenge, we will be preparing to drive along a miniature model of the
Macau Grand Prix route which by itself will pose us plenty of challenges.

The goal of the challenge is to win the race!  
The following things you need to keep in mind to succeed with your team:

- You cannot modify the route but you can train on the specific parts
of the route as much as you want
- The initial goal is to finish the route regardless of time
- After finishing the route think about ways how you may improve the performance
(and what defines the performance in this case?)
- Try to write clean code in the good quality, feel free to ask the tutors
- Prepare for a presentation of your car.
You do not want it to be as plain as it is. Maybe add some Neopixel action?
Give a name for your bit:bot and prepare to explain what your ideas were!


The presentation and the final race will be happening in the final showcase
in the last session we meet.
