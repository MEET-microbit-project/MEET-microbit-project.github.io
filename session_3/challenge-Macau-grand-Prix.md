Bit:bot challenge: Macau Grand Prix
====================================

For a bit:bot programming challenge we decided o explore the work of racing cars and what the better way to do that than in Macau Grand Prix!

The Macau Grand Prix  is a motor-racing event held annually in Macau. It is known for being the only street circuit racing event in which both car and motorcycle races are held. The first Macau Grand Prix event was held in 1954, as a sports car event. In 1961, the title race became an open-wheel Formula Libre event. The event has also had a variety of support races in its duration. Production cars joined the event in 1957, which were superseded by touring cars in 1972. The event received world championship status from 2005 to 2014 as the final round of the World Touring Car Championship. In 1976, the Macau Motorcycle Grand Prix was introduced. In 2008, a GT3 race was added to the event, which became known as the FIA GT World Cup.

Of course trying ta take down the real Grand Prix may be bit too much for our challenge because as we talked in previous sessions the real world is complex with a lot of uncertainties in it, moreover If out little bit:bots would try to travel the hole route it is certainly the case that they would run out of power quite fast.

In our challenge, we will be preparing to take the miniature model of Macau Grand Prix route which by itself will pose us plenty of challenges.

The goal of the challenge is to win the race but how actually we determined the winner?  These are the following things that you need to keep in mind to reach the success for your team:

- You cannot modify the route but you can train on the specific part of the route as much as you want
- The initial goal is to finish the route regardless of time
- After finishing the route think about the way how you may improve the performance (and what defines a performance in this case)
- Try to make your code in the good quality by the guidance given by the tutors
- Prepare for a presentation of your car. You do not want it to be as plain as it is. Give a name for your bit:bot and be prepared to talk about how did it go to make it work


The presentation and the final race will be happening in the final showcase in the last session we meet.
